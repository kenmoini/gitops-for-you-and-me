# This kustomization file will load the adjacent directories to initialize a Hub-of-Hubs cluster that has OpenShift GitOps installed.
## Inside the specified folders there is another kustomization file that will be loaded and
## essentially just points to the adjacent YAML files.

## This Kustomization file will take a cluster after it has the OpenShift GitOps operator installed and
## will deploy the ArgoCD CR instance and create the rest of the resources needed to run the Hub-of-Hubs cluster.
